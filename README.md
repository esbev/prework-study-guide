# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

At the beginning of this project I asn't sure what to expect, but I knew it wasn't going to simply be moving from point A to point B. I did not create this page out of a necessity for course requirements, but rather to build on my current knowledge and learn from more experienced people some basic and key skills for my upcoming course. This project in itself does not have a large list of solutions it can solve. However, the biggest solution it has is that it has allows an introduction to some fundamental elements of web development to be learned. I gained some highly important knowledge and skills throughout the modules while building this page in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This guide can be used as a simple display of some key concepts and elements for web development using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. There are a few highlighted lessons learned, but this is by far not an exaustive list on learned topics and skills. You should be able to use this guide to grasp a basic understanding of what I will be diving into over the next 6 months.

Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
